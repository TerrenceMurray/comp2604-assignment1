1. Blocked -> Running
If a high-priority process is waiting on an event, the OS may allow
the process to transition directly to the Running state.

2. Ready -> Blocked
Although a process does not ordinarily transition from a Ready to Blocked state directly, 
in some cases such as if a resource which the process requires becomes
unavailable.
